Compiled by Keith Jenkins <kgj2@cornell.edu>, GIS Librarian at Mann Library.


## New York State

* CUGIR  
https://cugir.library.cornell.edu/  
Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository.  Includes New York data from a variety of federal, state, and local government sources, as well as Cornell research projects.  New website coming soon!

* NYS GIS Clearinghouse  
http://gis.ny.gov/  
New York State Geographic Information Systems Clearinghouse.  Includes data created by state, county, and local governments across New York.  (Some datasets require login -- contact kgj2@cornell.edu for access.)

* NYS Orthos Online  
https://orthos.dhses.ny.gov/  
New York State aerial photos from 1994 to the present.  (Each county is updated every 4-5 years.)  Also includes DEMs (digital elevation models) at 10m resolution for the entire state, plus 1m and 2m for selected areas.

* Historical Aerial Photographs of New York  
https://digital.library.cornell.edu/collections/aerialny  
Aerial photos dating back to 1936.  Only Cayuga, Cortland, Onondaga, Seneca, Tompkins, and Wayne counties are available on the website, but Cornell IRIS has the original photographs for many other counties.


## United States

* Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles  
https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html  
Spatial data for boundaries of legal and statistical areas such as states, counties, census tracts, block-groups, blocks, zipcode tabulation areas, legislative boundaries, school districts, etc.  (Also includes roads and water features, although probably not as detailed or current as other sources.)

* National Map  
https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/  
Download a variety of data layers for any arbitrary region.  Includes current and historical USGS topographic maps, orthoimagery, NLCD (National Land Cover Database), and NED (National Elevation Dataset).

* Data.gov  
https://data.gov/  
Extensive data catalog of federal government agencies, selected state and local governments, and other sources.

* List of State GIS Data Sources  
http://libweb.uoregon.edu/map/map_section/map_Statedatasets.html


## International

* GADM  
http://www.gadm.org/  
Download administrative boundaries of second-level subdivisions (or lower) by country, or for the whole world.

* OpenStreetMap  
http://www.openstreetmap.org/  
A free, collaborative, editable map of the world.  The current map can be viewed at the link above -- check your area of interest to see what level of detail is available.  To download as data, click “Export” for various options, or go directly to these sites for easy-to-use shapefiles:
  * http://download.geofabrik.de/	(daily data extracts by country)
  * https://export.hotosm.org/	(custom extracts by user-selected area)

* Geolode.org  
http://geolode.org/  
A catalog of over 700 geospatial data websites worldwide.  This project started at Cornell, and is maintained by GIS librarians at several universities.


## Library resources

* GeoLytics  
(CD-ROMs available at Olin Library, reference collection)  
Geolytics provides access to US Census data from 1970 to 2010.  Software on these discs provide a simple interface for extracting and mapping selected variables and locations.

* SimplyAnalytics  
http://resolver.library.cornell.edu/misc/6168667  
Formerly known as SimplyMap, this site offers thematic maps and reports of demographic, business, and marketing data for the United States.  Some of the marketing data is incredibly specific -- ("# Households buying car wax and polish in last 12 months" or "% Households engaged in marathon/triathon training and events").  To export shapefiles of the data, click the ☰ menu.

* LandScan  
http://resolver.library.cornell.edu/misc/7656094  
Global population density raster data at 1-km resolution for each year 2000-2017.


## Finding other sources

Try searching the web, using country/province/city name and terms like "GIS data", "shp", "shapefile", etc.  Try variants using the local language, like `Colombia SIG datos`.  Local governments and NGOs may share geospatial data, although availability varies from place to place.  Even if data is not readily downloadable from an organization's website, it might be possible to find a contact name and e-mail address.  When making a request by e-mail, be explicit about what data you are looking for, and be sure to mention that you will be using the data for an academic course project.
